"""FastAPI dependencies."""

# This file will contain FastAPI dependency injection functions
# For now it's just a placeholder and will be expanded when we implement services

# Example of a dependency (will be implemented later):
# def get_db():
#     db = SessionLocal()
#     try:
#         yield db
#     finally:
#         db.close()
